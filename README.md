For any recruiter: I started this project almost a year ago with the hope of saving myself the trouble of manually typing in lobby names and passwords in Rocket League, an online game I play regularly. 

It turned into quite the challenge from safely handling network security (concerning authentication and routing), to thread safety with lock free queues, and establishing connections off a thread seperate than the game one. I was forced to make this in c++, and this was before I had ever taken a c++ class. Please keep in mind it is a work in progress. As of my writing this, it successfully can create/join games automatically, working GUI, can connect to my personal linux server running a websocket python script. It is likely I'll forget to update this seperate public repo, so please ask about any recent improvements I've made. Up next on my todo would be designing the json payloads and finalizing the token generation for users to paste into it (for their login process).
